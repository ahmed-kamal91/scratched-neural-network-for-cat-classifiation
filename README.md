funny app to detect whether cat or not by importing image you want to challenge the model with ðŸ¤“

<h2>Notes ðŸ§ª</h2>
this model is the result of learning from the first course of deep learning specialization <br/>
and almost have all concept that took inside the course

<h2>Requirements ðŸ¦„</h2>
numpy<br/>
Pillow<br/>
matplotlib<br/>

<h2>Accuracy ðŸ“Š</h2>
train accuracy = 98% <br/>
test accuracy = 80% <br/>
